# Mechatronics Engineering in FUNAAB

Mechatronics Engineering is a relatively new course in Nigerian universities at the Bachelor's level. 
It's an exciting and challenging field for students interested in Robotics and Automation. 
The [Department of Mechatronics Engineering in FUNAAB](https://www.amtesfunaab.com.ng/) was founded in 2015, 
with Prof. Aborisade as the first Head of the Department.

## Why Study Mechatronics Engineering?

### 1. **Exciting Career Opportunities**
Mechatronics Engineering is a versatile field that combines **mechanical** engineering, **electronics** engineering, 
**computer** science, **control** engineering, and **artificial intelligence**. 
This interdisciplinary approach opens up a wide range of career opportunities in industries such as manufacturing, 
automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and entertainment.

The FUNAAB Mechatronics Engineering department has produced graduates who now work in companies under the following spaces:
- Software companies (including FinTechs and e-commerce companies)
- Power Tech companies
- Hometronics and smart home automation companies
- Automobile companies
- Renewable energy companies
- Academia
- Many others.

### 2. **Innovative and Futuristic**
The world is moving towards automation and artificially intelligent systems, as you may have observed already.
Existing technologies are being wrapped or optimized to have AI features, while new and emerging technologies come with AI right out of the box.
Studying Mechatronics Engineering will definitely  you with the skills to be at the forefront of this technological revolution. 
You can work on exciting projects like designing robots, developing smart home systems, or creating advanced medical devices.

For many years, most of the final year projects done in the Mechatronics Engineering department were incorporated with Artificial Intelligence,
not only to provide the system with a degree of automation, but also to prepare students for the current job market.

### 3. **High Demand for Skills**
As industries continue to automate and integrate smart systems, there is a growing demand for professionals with expertise in Mechatronics. This means better job prospects and potentially higher salaries for graduates in this field.

## What You'll Learn

### 1. **Core Subjects**
You'll start with foundational courses in mathematics, physics, and basic engineering principles. As you progress, you'll delve into more specialized subjects such as:

- **Mechanical Systems Design:** Learn how to design and analyze mechanical components and systems.
- **Electrical and Electronic Systems:** Understand circuits, signals, and power systems.
- **Computer Programming and Software Development:** Gain skills in programming languages like C++, Python, and Assembly, PLC programming, etc.
- **Control Systems:** Study how to design systems that can control and automate processes.
- **Robotics:** Explore the design, construction, and operation of robots.

### 2. **Hands-On Experience**
FUNAAB's Mechatronics Engineering program emphasizes both a theoretical and practical learning.
You have access to the general laboratory, although the Virtual Prototyping laboratory is only used when there is a workshop session.

MTE 102 introduces you in freshman year to Mechatronics Engineering, and you learn about sensors and actuators, robotics, and automated systems.
You get a hands-on experience with the Arduino UNO microcontroller and Fritzing software for prototyping electronic circuits.

> You're advised to develop yourself personally with these tools, try to procure an Arduino UNO complete kit for yourself, and learn
> how to use Fritzing. Build different projects and improve your skills. This will be useful in convincing a company to hire you during your internship
> in year four.

In your second year, you take the Students' Work Experience Program (SWEP) where you learn about different engineering-related parts of FUNAAB. During
the course of this, you will learn the following:
- how to collaborate with engineers from other disciplines
- workshop safety practices
- engineering communication practices
- Arduino programming and prototyping
- electronic devices and how to troubleshoot them
- mechanical engines and how to troubleshoot them

In CSC201, you will learn about computer architecture and organization, along with the C++ programming language.

In your third year, you will learn about FPGA programming, logic circuits and microcontrollers. You will go deeper in electronic devices and their
applications. You will learn about sensors and actuators, entrepreneurship in engineering, and advanced engineering mathematics that are pre-requisite to
machine learning.

You will also go for your Student's Industrial Work Experience Seminar I (SIWES I) where you will put all that you have learned into practice,
depending on the company/industry you choose to intern at. AMTES as a body, Mechatronics Engineering as a department,
and the SWEP as a program are all working together to make it easier for you to get a befitting internship placement both in your third and fourth year.
However, your skills, network, and awareness will serve you a lot in it. Hopefully, you have worked on projects (both self-induced and as part of a course)
that would make you stand out during your application phase.

In fourth year, you will also learn about:
- CNC machining and programming
- computer aided design and manufacturing
- statistics
- computer hardware engineering

In your fifth -- and final year, God willing ðŸ˜… --, you will learn about:
- advanced control systems
- microcontroller architecture
- the Assembly language
- machine vision and AI in practice
- embedded systems design and development
- PLC programming and ladder logic
- mobile robotics.

Now, some of these classes will be theoretical, but you are at leisure to go further into the subject-matter, because you are mainly responsible
for your own education.

By the end of your 5-year stay in FUNAAB Mechatronics Engineering department, you must have had a rich theoretical and practical background into
robotics and automated systems. You would be asked to build projects in groups, and the hands-on experience is crucial 
for developing problem-solving skills and gaining confidence in your abilities. Your B.Eng. would be well achieved.
