# Mechatronics Engineering in FUNAAB

Mechatronics Engineering is a relatively new course in Nigerian universities at the Bachelor's level. 
It's an exciting and challenging field for students interested in Robotics and Automation. 
The [Department of Mechatronics Engineering in FUNAAB](https://www.amtesfunaab.com.ng/) was founded in 20XX, 
with Prof. Aborisade as the first Head of the Department.

## Why Study Mechatronics Engineering?

### 1. **Exciting Career Opportunities**
Mechatronics Engineering is a versatile field that combines **mechanical** engineering, **electronics** engineering, 
**computer** science, **control** engineering, and **artificial intelligence**. 
This interdisciplinary approach opens up a wide range of career opportunities in industries such as manufacturing, 
automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and entertainment.

The FUNAAB Mechatronics Engineering department has produced graduates who now work in companies under the following spaces:
- Software companies (including FinTechs and e-commerce companies)
- Power Tech companies
- Hometronics and smart home automation companies
- Automobile companies
- Renewable energy companies
- Academia
- Many others.

### 2. **Innovative and Futuristic**
The world is moving towards automation and artificially intelligent systems, as you may have observed already.
Existing technologies are being wrapped or optimized to have AI features, while new and emerging technologies come with AI right out of the box.
Studying Mechatronics Engineering will definitely  you with the skills to be at the forefront of this technological revolution. 
You can work on exciting projects like designing robots, developing smart home systems, or creating advanced medical devices.

For many years, most of the final year projects done in the Mechatronics Engineering department were incorporated with Artificial Intelligence,
not only to provide the system with a degree of automation, but also to prepare students for the current job market.

### 3. **High Demand for Skills**
As industries continue to automate and integrate smart systems, there is a growing demand for professionals with expertise in Mechatronics. This means better job prospects and potentially higher salaries for graduates in this field.

## What You'll Learn

### 1. **Core Subjects**
You'll start with foundational courses in mathematics, physics, and basic engineering principles. As you progress, you'll delve into more specialized subjects such as:

- **Mechanical Systems Design:** Learn how to design and analyze mechanical components and systems.
- **Electrical and Electronic Systems:** Understand circuits, signals, and power systems.
- **Computer Programming and Software Development:** Gain skills in programming languages like C++, Python, and Assembly, PLC programming, etc.
- **Control Systems:** Study how to design systems that can control and automate processes.
- **Robotics:** Explore the design, construction, and operation of robots.

### 2. **Hands-On Experience**
FUNAAB's Mechatronics Engineering program emphasizes both a theoretical and practical learning.
You have access to the general laboratory, although the Virtual Prototyping laboratory is only used when there is a workshop session.

MTE 102 introduces you in freshman year to Mechatronics Engineering, and you learn about sensors and actuators, robotics, and automated systems.
You get a hands-on experience with the Arduino UNO microcontroller and Fritzing software for prototyping electronic circuits.

> You're advised to develop yourself personally with these tools, try to procure an Arduino UNO complete kit for yourself, and learn
> how to use Fritzing. Build different projects and improve your skills. This will be useful in convincing a company to hire you during your internship
> in year four.

In your second year, you take the Students' Work Experience Program (SWEP) where you learn about different engineering-related parts of FUNAAB. During
the course of this, you will learn the following:
- how to collaborate with engineers from other disciplines
- workshop safety practices
- engineering communication practices
- Arduino programming and prototyping

In CSC201, you will learn about computer architecture and organization, and you will learn about the C++ programming language. 

You'll have access to well-equipped laboratories where you can apply your theoretical knowledge to real-world projects. This hands-on experience is crucial for developing problem-solving skills and gaining confidence in your abilities.

## Career Paths in Mechatronics Engineering

### 1. **Robotics Engineer**
Design, build, and maintain robots for various applications, from manufacturing to healthcare.

### 2. **Automation Engineer**
Develop systems that automate industrial processes, increasing efficiency and productivity.

### 3. **Control Systems Engineer**
Design and implement control systems that manage the behavior of machines and systems.

### 4. **Product Development Engineer**
Work on creating new products or improving existing ones, integrating mechanical, electrical, and software components.

### 5. **Research and Development (R&D) Engineer**
Engage in cutting-edge research to develop new technologies and innovations in mechatronics.
